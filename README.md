# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020 Challenges](https://adventofcode.com/) that I have attempted. I probably won't be able to complete this for the entire advent (I'll get bored and forget to do it, or find it too difficult).

I'll mainly be using Python, though may venture into R if I get stuck/need to.
